                            "I am happy to share my experience with EcoLight Innovation's solar lighting packages. Before, my grocery store would close at 5:30 pm due to darkness. But after installing their solar lights on July 21st, 2025, I can now stay open till 9 pm, giving me extra hours to serve my customers. This has not only boosted my sales but also helped my customers with tight schedules to have access and be able to buy at evening hours. I am grateful for EcoLight Innovation's flexible installment payment system, which makes their products accessible to us rural dwellers. Thank you, EcoLight Innovation, for remembering us and continue your good work."
